# Vercel Deployment - Final Setup

**Production Domain** (once protection is disabled): https://leadscorer.vercel.app

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Disable Deployment Protection

Your API is currently protected by Vercel authentication, which prevents public access. You need to disable this for your API to work.

### Steps to Disable Protection:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/sieve-fresh/leadscorer

2. **Navigate to Settings**
   - Click on "Settings" tab at the top

3. **Find Deployment Protection**
   - Look for "Deployment Protection" in the left sidebar
   - Or go directly to: https://vercel.com/sieve-fresh/leadscorer/settings/deployment-protection

4. **Disable Protection**
   - Click on "Deployment Protection"
   - Change setting to "Disabled" or "Standard Protection Only"
   - Click "Save"

5. **Redeploy (Optional)**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents/leadscorer
   vercel --prod
   ```

## Testing Your API

Once protection is disabled, test with:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://leadscorer.vercel.app/health

# Score a domain
curl "https://leadscorer.vercel.app/score?domain=shopify.com"
```

# Usage

```

### JavaScript Example

const API_URL = "https://leadscorer.vercel.app";

async function scoreLead(domain) {
  const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/score?domain=${domain}`);
  return await response.json();
}

// Usage
